                    <p class="projdescription2">
                        Two platform games made in Unity's 3D engine and coded in C# through Microsoft's Integrated Development Environment, Visual Studio. 

                        Creating these games were a lot of fun as I had never been a big fan of video games. However, that quickly changed when I took my first game development class and created my first real 3D game.
                        
                        It was a challenging experience learning everything from scratch especially being someone who had barely any gaming experience. Additionally, having to learn a whole new language wasn't the easiest but as the semester went by, I felt more confident about myself. I grew to really love the class and game development as a whole and I was also incredibly proud of the games I made.

                                This User-Friendly App was made in Apple's Xcode 15 using the Swift and Swift Ui development framework.

                                ​It showcases a pantry tracking system that allows each user to view, add and store items based on their pantry.

                <p class="projdescription4">
                    EarSketch is a Python/JavaScript coding platform that allows users to create music through code. This was a fun project to work on as someone who really enjoys all kinds of music.

                    ​Though this platform offers both coding languages, I chose to create my project in Python. This interactive project allows users to choose their genre of music from a digital jukebox with a variable list of music choices.                 </p>

            <p class="projdescription5">
                At Code Ninjas, I had an opportunity to learn Javascript through a fun and interactive platform. By learning and practicing through game making, I was able to relay what I had learned to my code mentees and be more of an effective instructor. 

                I created a simple game that required a player to grab as many stars as possible before the time run out, while also avoiding moving enemies. If the player managed to grab enough stars, he or she progresses to the next level. 
                
                This was one of the first games I created. So, it may not be the most impressive thing but I can confidently say, this experience is what pushed me to get into the world of game development class.               </p>
